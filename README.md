# What is Linear Regression?
# Linear Regression is a method used to define a relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and independent variable (X)
# which is written as y = mx + c
# Where y is the dependent variable, m is the scale factor or coefficient(slope of the line), c being the bias coefficient(y-intercept) and X being the independent variable
